## 📘 Semester 2  

### 📖 OOP & Data  

#### 🔹 Assignments  
- **Assignment 1:** 
  Reads an integer from the user and prints it along with explanatory messages.
- **Assignment 2:** 
  Reads an unspecified number of integers from the user, then calculates and displays the largest integer, largest even integer, count of positive numbers, and the sum of all numbers.
- **Assignment 3:**
  Prints key computer science ethical principles with real-world examples illustrating how violating these principles affects professional conduct.
- **Assignment 4:**
  Implements a menu-driven program that allows the user to add and display team information, continuing until the user chooses to quit.
- **Assignment 5:**
  Implements multiple classes using inheritance to manage a guild of heroes, allowing users to add heroes, compute combat points, count heroes above a threshold, and list all heroes.
- **Assignment 6:**
  Creates a JavaFX application with a TabPane featuring two tabs: one for adding heroes and another for creating an army, allowing interactive management of hero objects.
- **Assignment 7:**
  Creates a JavaFX application that sets up a window for a SketchPane, providing a canvas for interactive drawing.

## 🗒️ Notes  
- Some projects require additional files (`.java`, `.txt`, or helper classes).  
- Each course folder is self-contained and can be compiled/run independently.  
- Languages vary by course (Java, Python, C, etc.).
