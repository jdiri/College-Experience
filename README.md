## 📘 Semester 2  

### 📖 OOP & Data  

#### 🔹 Assignments  
- **Assignment 1:** 
  Reads an integer from the user and prints it along with explanatory messages.
- **Assignment 2:** 
  Reads an unspecified number of integers from the user, then calculates and displays the largest integer, largest even integer, count of positive numbers, and the sum of all numbers.
- **Assignment 3:**
  Prints key computer science ethical principles with real-world examples illustrating how violating these principles affects professional conduct.
- **Assignment 4:**
  Implements a menu-driven program that allows the user to add and display team information, continuing until the user chooses to quit.
- **Assignment 5:**
  Implements multiple classes using inheritance to manage a guild of heroes, allowing users to add heroes, compute combat points, count heroes above a threshold, and list all heroes.
- **Assignment 6:**
  Creates a JavaFX application with a TabPane featuring two tabs: one for adding heroes and another for creating an army, allowing interactive management of hero objects.
- **Assignment 7:**
  Creates a JavaFX application that sets up a window for a SketchPane, providing a canvas for interactive drawing.
- **Assignment 8:** 
  Builds a restaurant review management system with features to add, search, list, sort, and remove reviews, as well as save and load reviews using text files and serialization.
- **Assignment 9:** 
  Implements recursive solutions to array and string problems, including finding the largest number, multiplying primes, calculating the largest digit sum, and removing adjacent duplicates in strings.
- **Assignment 10:** 
  Implemented a JavaFX application with interactive features and custom panes. Demonstrated handling of events, layout management, and dynamic updates in the UI.  
- **Assignment 11:** 
  Created a JavaFX-based project integrating multiple panes and user-driven controls. Focused on building reusable components and managing scene transitions effectively. 
- **Assignment 12:** 
  Builds a JavaFX GUI with interactive wave simulations. Two wave panes (maroon and gold) are displayed in a grid layout, each with independent movement controls.

## 📘 Semester 3  

### 📖 Digital Design  

#### 🔹 Capstone ALU Project  
- A finite-state, gate-level comparator built in Digital, using D_FF state bits (q1–q3) and inputs clk/reset, to decide L/R/E for two bus inputs W₁ and W₂ each cycle.  

#### 🔹 Assignments  
Practice circuits and smaller projects, including:  
- 2-layer circuit  
- Alarm system  
- Base-12 counter  
- D flip-flop  
- JK flip-flop  
- SR Latch
- Clocked Sequential Circuit

#### 🔹 Labs  
More in-depth guided exercises:  
- **Lab 0:** XOR gate implemented using AND, OR, NOT gates  
- **Lab 1:** Incrementer, half-adder, full-adder, and 4-bit adder  
- **Lab 2:** ALU utilizing components from Lab 1  
- **Lab 3:** Simplified (“brainless”) ALU  
- **Lab 4:** Integrates previous lab components into a complete 4-bit calculator  

All files include **Verilog HDL** (`.v`) designs, **Logisim** circuit diagrams (`.dig`), and supporting **text** or **hex** files for simulation and testing. 

### 📖 Programming Languages  

Assignments and exercises from exploring multiple programming paradigms:  
- **C** – procedural programming exercises  
- **C++** – object-oriented programming samples  
- **Prolog** – logic programming with facts, rules, and queries

📘 **Semester 4**

📖 **Data Structures & Algorithms**

🔹 **Assignments / Projects**

This course explores fundamental and advanced data structures through hands-on implementations used in a larger **Flight Management and Navigation System** project.

Each folder demonstrates both core algorithms and applied graph theory concepts:

- **Kruskal/** – Implements Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to find optimal flight route networks.  
- **Dijkstra/** – Computes shortest flight paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm on directed and undirected graphs.  
- **Hashmaps/** – Stores and retrieves flight data efficiently, mapping city codes and routes.  
- **LinkedLists/** – Manages dynamic lists of flights, passengers, and route histories.  
- **MaxHeaps/** – Prioritizes flights by distance, capacity, or importance in scheduling operations.  
- **RedBlackTrees/** – Maintains balanced structures for rapid flight lookup and insertion operations.

Together, these modules could form an integrated **graph-based flight navigation simulator**, allowing efficient route computation and airline management.


📖 **Software Engineering**

🔹 **Projects**

1. **Medical Office Management System**  
   A software solution designed for patient data management, appointment scheduling, and billing tracking.  
   Emphasizes modular architecture, user input validation, and maintainable class hierarchies.

2. **Deli Ordering System**  
   Implements an ordering and inventory management system for a deli, featuring customer order processing, item tracking, and dynamic pricing updates.  
   Focused on team-based development, requirement documentation, and iterative testing.

## 🗒️ Notes  
- Some projects require additional files (`.java`, `.txt`, or helper classes).  
- Each course folder is self-contained and can be compiled/run independently.  
- Languages vary by course (Java, Python, C, etc.).
