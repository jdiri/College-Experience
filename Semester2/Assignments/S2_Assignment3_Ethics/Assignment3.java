MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and\npromote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.\n-An engineer must always go about making software in an ethical matter such as no plagirizing other peoples code and work or making\ncode that meets only some of the requirements mentioned by the client\nthis one i believe goes hand in hand with colleague ethics-This violates ethics of Computer Science");

PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related \nmodifications meet the highest professional standards possible.\n-meaning the engineer must uphold their contract with the client by meeting\nall requirements mention to the best of their ability and not opting out\nfor the error prone way that causes the software to only run correctly sometimes-This violates ethics of Computer Science");
		System.out.println("\n7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.\n- people should be treated with respect and there should be no discrimination in the work place such as\nover burdening someone with work or isolating them from the project-This violates ethics of Computer Science");
		System.out.println("\n8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice\nof their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.\n-As scientist we should always be striving for knowledge but this strive for knowledge must not violate the code of ethics,\nA software engineer has the power to create bad programs but it is their responsibility to not, because creating this even if to observe could have outcomes not predicted-This violates ethics of Computer Science");
